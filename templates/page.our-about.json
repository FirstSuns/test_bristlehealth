Patients have more information and data, which can be very motivating, and we now have metrics to determine if our treatments and protocols are actually shifting things toward health and balance in their children. I am so excited to see where Oral Microbiome research is headed, and Bristle is certainly paving the way toward better patient outcomes and understanding root cause issues within our patients.”",

With a simple noninvasive saliva test, we can assess patients' periodontal and caries risk rather than just waiting for bone loss and decay. Why wait for a heart attack or stroke to treat cardiovascular diseases if you see elevated biomarkers in blood tests? The same should be true in the future for dental care.”",
